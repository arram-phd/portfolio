Professional 
-------------
I am currently a Scientific Account Manager at Genedata, where I offer scientific consulting and support for Bio-pharma clients using the Genedata Screener software. 

I was previously a postdoctoral scholar in the Albeck Lab at the University of California, Davis. In the same group, I completed my PhD research involving the regulation of gene expression by cell signaling pathways. My research specifically investigated  the role of ERK signaling in modulating protein expression at the single-cell level.

My methodology involved engineering cells to express a FRET-based biosensor for ERK, conducting live-cell imaging using a fluorescence microscope, and performing multiplexed immunofluorescence to capture the activation patterns of various proteins influenced by ERK signaling. 
This comprehensive approach resulted in the generation of a multi-dimensional dataset, encompassing kinase activity and the resulting protein expression profiles in over 100,000 individual cells.

Throughout this project, I developed a wide range of skills, including high-throughput and high-content microscopy, multiplex immunofluorescence, and advanced programming for image analysis. 
My responsibilities extended to cell segmentation, tracking, image registration, and the application of statistical and machine learning techniques to derive meaningful biological insights.
The diverse challenges of this work have solidified my determination to pursue a career in computational biology.
